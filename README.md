Iris-Dataset-Clustering-Analysis

Problem Statement: 
Using the Iris Dataset, I employed unsupervised learning techniques to predict the optimum number of clusters and visually represented the results.

Programming Language:  "Python" is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility.Python emphasizes code readability and a clean syntax, making it easy for developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to languages like C++ or Java.

Proposed solution: 1)The Iris dataset is loaded and standardized using StandardScaler.
                  2)Standardizes the data.
                  3)Applies KMeans clustering with the optimal number of clusters.
                  4)Adds cluster labels to the original Iris dataset.
                  5)The results are visualized using a scatter plot.
                  
System Approach:The "System Approach" section outlines the overall strategy and methodology for developing and implementing the Iris-Dataset-Clustering-Analysis.
System Requirements-To conduct an Iris Dataset Clustering Analysis, you'll need a computing environment that supports data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. 
Here are the system requirements:
Dataset: Download the Iris dataset. 
         In the provided code example, it uses the Iris dataset from scikit-learn, but you can also obtain it from various sources, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Google Collab
Documentation and Collaboration: Choose a platform for documentation and collaboration, such as Jupyter Notebooks for interactive documentation or Markdown files for READMEs in your Git repository.

Algorithm and Deployment :
Algorithm Selection : "k-Means Clustering Algorithm" 
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a predetermined number of clusters. It is widely employed for various applications such as image segmentation, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection.
Data Input: The data input typically consists of a dataset where each data point is represented as a vector of features. The algorithm uses these feature vectors to group similar data points into clusters. Here are the key components of the data input used in the K-means clustering algorithm: Dataset,Number of Clusters (K),Centroids Initialization.
Training Process:The K-means clustering algorithm involves an iterative training process where data points are assigned to clusters, and cluster centroids are updated until convergence. 
Prediction Process :The K-means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm, and it doesn't have a typical "prediction" process like supervised learning algorithms. Instead, once the K-means model is trained on the data, you can use it to assign new data points to the clusters it has learned. Here's how you can apply K-means clustering to the Iris dataset and assign new data points to clusters.

Result: 1) Data points are plotted based on their true labels.
        2)Centroids of the clusters are marked with large black circles.
        3)The diagonal elements represent the number of data points that were correctly assigned to their true class.
        4)Off-diagonal elements indicate misclassifications.
        5)The accuracy score gives the overall accuracy of the clustering.
